# Customer-Behavior-Dashboard---Power-BI--MySQL--Python

Customer Behavior Dashboard

Tools Used: Power BI | MySQL | Python

This project focuses on analyzing consumer shopping behavior to help a retail company enhance sales, customer satisfaction, and loyalty. Using Python, the data was cleaned and processed before being stored in MySQL for structured querying. The insights were then visualized in Power BI, creating an interactive dashboard that highlights key metrics such as customer demographics, purchase trends, revenue by category, and sales by age group.

The dashboard enables data-driven decision-making by revealing factors that influence customer purchases—such as product categories, shipping preferences, and subscription status—helping the business optimize marketing and product strategies.
